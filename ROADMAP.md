# Temporal Knowledge Graph Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and enhancements for our Temporal Knowledge Graph system, designed to provide superior performance, flexibility, and intelligence compared to existing solutions like [Zep](https://www.getzep.com/).

## High Priority Features

### 1. Hybrid Vector + Graph Architecture

Enhance the existing temporal graph with dense vector embeddings to create a hybrid retrieval system that outperforms pure vector and pure graph approaches.

- Vector embedding storage for entities and relationships
- Integration with existing temporal graph structure
- Fusion algorithms to combine graph and vector retrieval results
- Ranking and re-ranking mechanisms
- Optimization for both sparse and dense retrieval
- Benchmarking system against Zep and other vector DBs

### 2. Recursive Retrieval with Multi-hop Reasoning

Implement iterative graph traversal with vector similarity at each hop, allowing complex multi-step reasoning through the knowledge graph.

- Multi-hop graph traversal algorithm
- Relevance scoring across multiple hops
- Path explanation generation
- Configurable hop depth limits
- Cycle detection and handling
- Specialized indexes for efficient path traversal
- Integration with vector similarity at each hop

## Medium Priority Features

### 3. Temporal-aware Vector Embeddings

Extend vector embeddings to incorporate temporal information directly, enabling more accurate retrieval based on time context.

- Time-decay functions for relevance scoring
- Temporal context integration in embedding generation
- Specialized vector indexes for time-window queries
- Optimization for fast temporal similarity search
- Time-based vector transformation functions
- Embedding versioning aligned with temporal graph

### 4. Adaptive Retrieval Strategy Router

Build a system that dynamically selects between graph traversal, vector similarity, or hybrid approaches based on query characteristics.

- Query classifier to determine optimal retrieval method
- Strategy selection based on query complexity and type
- Performance tracking and self-optimization
- Feedback loop for strategy improvement
- A/B testing framework for strategy comparison
- Fallback mechanisms for query edge cases

### 5. Enhanced Entity Tracking with Explicit Versioning

Extend the temporal storage system with explicit versioning and property-level differencing to track detailed entity evolution.

- Explicit version tracking for entities
- Property-level differencing algorithm
- Efficient storage for incremental changes
- Version comparison capabilities
- Version rollback functionality
- Entity history visualization
- Conflict detection and resolution

## Low Priority Features

### 6. Extended Query Builder with Inferential Logic

Enhance the query builder to support inferential patterns that combine explicit graph relationships with inferred logical connections.

- Logical operators for query composition
- Inference rule definition system
- Optimization layer for inference queries
- Explanation generation for inference paths
- Confidence scoring for inferred relationships
- Support for common logical patterns and rules
- Integration with existing temporal constraints

## Implementation Strategy

The features will be implemented in phases, with dependencies managed to ensure a logical progression:

1. First phase focuses on the hybrid architecture (1) as it forms the foundation for more advanced features
2. Second phase implements multi-hop reasoning (2) and temporal vector embeddings (3)
3. Third phase adds the adaptive strategy router (4) and enhanced versioning (5)
4. Final phase extends the query builder with inferential capabilities (6)

Each feature will include comprehensive benchmarks against comparable systems, with particular attention to outperforming Zep's temporal knowledge graph in terms of:

- Query latency and throughput
- Retrieval accuracy and relevance
- Memory efficiency
- Temporal precision
- Complex reasoning capabilities

## Success Metrics

Success will be measured through:

1. **Performance**: At least 30% faster query times than Zep for comparable operations
2. **Relevance**: Higher precision and recall in knowledge retrieval tasks
3. **Capabilities**: Supporting more complex temporal reasoning patterns
4. **Efficiency**: Lower resource consumption for similar workloads
5. **Flexibility**: Greater adaptability to different knowledge domains and query types
